## Vision Statement 

### The problem we are trying to solve.

Within our Canadian and Quebec scientific community we notice  several of the common themes that bring scientists to open science. And, despite several governmental and institutional ‘open science roadmaps’ here in Canada and Quebec, there is no clear pathway to understand why, nor how to do, ‘open science’.  This is epecially relevant, and noticeable at the level of the individual – whether beginner researcher, established PI, or even administrator. 

There is a broad spectrum of what is, and how to do, open science (which – quite frankly – can be overwhelming for anyone in the academic community). Additionally, the absence of clear guidelines, tools, and workshops is particularily startling among the french-speaking research communities. Indeed, there is very little french-speaking open science awareness, nor content. 

This project will therefore address two significan issue for researchers and students trying to do _science in the open_. 

First, create an accessible and structured web platform providing guidance with open science content and concrete resources for the scientific community. 

Secondly, achieving this by building an inclusive and global community by lowering the existing barrier of accessibility by making open and reproducible-related knowledge accessible in other languages than English. As this project will begin from within the scientific community of the University of Montreal, our initial efforts will be put focused on creating french content. 

### How we think openness and open leadership will help solve it.

We are working with and for the members of the University of Montreal to establish an inclusive and collaborative community where students and researchers at all stages of their careers feel welcome to learn, share, and discuss open science values, principles, and practices. 

As open science is a broad and wide-ranging concept with domain-specific definitions, we will provide opportunities to meet and encourage the exchange of ideas within and across fields because we can all learn from each other. By raising awareness, we hope this project will instigate a culture shift and help people realize how they can immediately benefit from using open and reproducible practices, making science more accessible, transparent and reproducible.

We hope that by optimizing the openness of the scientific process, by empowering the community through: a peer network to share and discuss with other open science enthusiasts; activities and conferences about issues in modern scientific processes; workshops on open research methods; creating learning resources; promoting open tools made by our own members.
